description: Ensure the agent reads the project background before each conversation
globs:
alwaysApply: true

Read this before starting every new conversation:

- MUST read `prompts/project-background.md` in full at the start of each conversation (or `@prompts/project-background.md` if present).
- Treat it as the canonical background for scope, terminology (速成/倉頡), constraints, and tech stack.
- Re-read if the file changes; align implementation and answers to it unless the user explicitly overrides.
